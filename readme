 -machine learning implementations/predictions with supervised-nonLinearRegression algorithms (RandomForest,GBM,XGB,LGBM...)
 -template codes and roadmap to fit and tune a model. (hyperparameter tuning and early-stopping)
 -template codes to observe the results ( result-df, feature_importance...)
  
In some methods, I inspired from Mustafa Vahit Keskin.
